## 1. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Swim Entries Manager Add-on and related support services.

## 2. Information We Process

When you use the Add-on, we may process:

- Account information available from Google Workspace, such as your email address.
- Spreadsheet content that you choose to create, edit, or export using the Add-on, including swimmer entry data and event/school/team details.
- Technical and operational data, such as error logs and basic usage events needed to operate and troubleshoot the Add-on.

We do not sell personal information.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use information to:

- Provide Add-on features (table creation, template duplication, CSV export).
- Maintain and improve reliability, performance, and security.
- Respond to support requests and diagnose issues.
- Comply with legal obligations.

## 4. Legal Basis (where applicable)

Where required by law, we process personal data based on:

- Your consent.
- Performance of a contract (providing the Add-on).
- Legitimate interests (security, reliability, support).
- Legal obligations.

## 5. Google APIs and Limited Use

The Add-on uses Google APIs and requested OAuth scopes only to provide user-facing functionality in Google Sheets.  
Use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.

## 6. Data Sharing

We may share data only:

- With service providers acting on our behalf (for hosting, logging, or support), under confidentiality obligations.
- When required by law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.
- To protect rights, security, and integrity of users, the Add-on, and the public.

We do not share Google user data with third parties for advertising purposes.

## 7. Data Retention

We retain data only as long as necessary to provide the Add-on and meet legal, accounting, or security requirements.  
Spreadsheet content remains in your Google environment unless you export, copy, or share it.

## 8. Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 9. International Transfers

If data is processed outside your country, we take appropriate steps to protect it in accordance with applicable law.

## 10. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to processing of your personal data, and to data portability.  
To make a request, contact us at `recorder@lvwasc.co.nz`.

## 11. Children's Privacy

The Add-on is intended for authorized school, club, and meet administrators. We do not intentionally collect personal information directly from children through the Add-on interface.

## 12. Third-Party Services

The Add-on operates within Google Workspace and may link to external services (for example, a CSV-to-SDIF converter). Those services have their own privacy policies and practices.

## 13. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a revised "Last updated" date.
